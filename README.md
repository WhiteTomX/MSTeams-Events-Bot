# Teams-Event-Bot
Get notifications about new and changed Events directly in Teams!

Currently you can create Events (Meetings) in the Calender App directly in Teams. Unfortunately Teams does not notify the invited atendees. It justs creates a normal invitation, that you can view in Outlook. But who whants to use Outlook?
Teams Event Bot to the rescue! Everytime a Event is added to your calender (because you were invited) it will message you abot it!
